# SnoozeMinder
<h3>A web app for calculating recommended wake up times according to a person's average sleep cycle!</h3>

<i>Uses NodeJS, Express, EJS for backend. HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend.</i>

Features time select button with calculator that calculates and displays calculated result on selected time input and two side pixel modals with pop up windows.

I wanted to be able to fully build a web app without following step-by-step tutorials, and I'm pretty proud of the result. Possibility for more features in the future, I would like to add a sleep quality tracker of sorts, and I want to make the knowledge of how sleep cycles work more of an interactive experience.
