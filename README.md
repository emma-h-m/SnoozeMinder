# SnoozeMinder
<h3>A web app for calculating recommended wake up times according to a person's average sleep cycle!</h3>

<i>Uses NodeJS, Express, EJS for backend. HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend.</i>

Features time select button with calculator that calculates and displays calculated result on selected time input and two side pixel modals with pop up windows.

This was my first venture into creating a proper web app. Possibility for more features in the future.
